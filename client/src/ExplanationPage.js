    <h1>Why do we need something like the Democratic Social Network?</h1>

    <p>For the last few decades, the situation for working class people in this country has grown steadily worse and worse. Houses are
    at least five times more expensive than they were in the 1980s even taking into account inflation. Wage growth has decreased substantially.
    The rate of unemployment has tripled since the 1970s. Union membership has gone down very dramatically.
    University, childcare and many other things people need have become much more costly. Our technology has improved dramatically and it should be vastly easier and cheaper to produce
    these essential goods and services. For example, very nice houses can be 3d printed for less than $4000 these days, yet people are still
    coerced into paying off mortgages for several decades. The economic levers that could be pulled to resolve
    these problems are well understood and there are a range of solutions that have proven to be practical.
    After all, even in Australia, we used to have these economic problems under much better control in the 1970s.
    It is not a question of if we know how to fix them, rather, we need to choose the sorts of leaders
    who would choose to persue the solutions. We need a system where leaders are much more accountable
    to the people they represent and where authority is much more grounded in knowledge, wisdom, moral
    integrity and empathy instead of coercive or exploitative power.

    The root of these problems is that our political system is not really very democratic
    and is quite heavily biased in favour of the rich. Almost all our politicians are very wealthy, belonging to the top 5% most wealthy members
    of our society or they receive campaign funding from wealthy people. They create and impose rules that make it easier to make more money for themselves. This is largely because political
    marketing campagins are very expensive and the mass media is controlled by very wealthy people.</p>

    <p>For thousands of years, political science has understood that there is an intimate relationship between a persons' economic/financial
    situation and their ability to participate in politics. Two and a half thousand years ago, the ancient Athenian democracy used to pay
    citizens to attend their assembly. They knew that some of the poorer members of society could not afford to take the time
    off work that was necessary to participate in politics. This helped to prevent group decisions from
    becoming biased in favour of the rich. This is not necessarily the perfect solution
    to this problem, but it is certainly the first recorded attempt to resolve this issue.
    If someone is struggling to meet their own basic needs because of poverty, (lack of housing, food,
      medicine, social interaction etc) they cannot think about a long term plan for their own lives and they certainly
      cannot afford to take the time to think about a long term plan for society. Financial security and stability are empowering.
      </p>

      <p>
      There is also very little democracy within most businesses, capitalist firms are undemocratic, the executives and shareholders are
      unelected and unaccountable to most of the people who work for the organization. There is no valid reason
      why we should be able to elect our politicians but not the leaders of the enterprises we work for.
      Corporate executives mostly only listen to the workers if the government or unions force them to.
      This does not necessarily need to be the case. Around the world there are millions of democratic
      businesses with hundreds of millions of members. Businesses where the workers are the shareholders,
      can elect their own leaders and vote on how to distribute profits. This is a very old and very
      reliable model of organization. We already have many of them in Australia.

      <h1>Exploitation?</h1>
      <p>
      Usually when we think of exploitation we imagine a slave owner whipping slave or something terrible
      like that, however in the modern world, exploitation is usually much more discrete.
      The labour theory of value first popularised by the classical
      economists David Ricardo and Adam Smith. The basic idea is that the value of all goods and services is roughly proportional
      to the human labour time invested in creating them, with some variation depending on the supply and demand. All the accounts
      gathered by the statistics bureaus of all developed countries show a very strong correlation between value created and human
      labour time, roughly 95%. When we take goods off the shelf, it is usually very difficult/impossible to know exactly how
      much labour time has gone into creating them because this information is not shared between the companies involved or the shop
      that sells the product. However, government statistics bureaus do gather and publish data about the total number of hours
      worked in each industry and the total value created in each industry. This can be plotted on a graph, and there is almost
      always a very strong correlation.
      (Zachariah, Dave. (2006). Labour value and equalisation of profit rate: A multi-country study. 4. https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.549.2098&rep=rep1&type=pdf
      Cockshott, Paul, Cottrell, Allin and Valle Baeza, Alejandro, (2014), The Empirics of the Labour Theory of Value: Reply to Nitzan and Bichler, EconStor Open Access Articles and Book Chapters, issue , p. 115-134, https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:espost:157802.)
      We can also calculate the average amount of value created
      per hour of human labour simply by adding all the value created in all industries then dividing it by the sum of all hours worked
      in all industries. In Australia in 2020, the average value created per hour of labour was $83 AUD, the average wage was
      only $59. The median hourly rate of pay was only $36. Even without factoring in the obscenely high cost of living,
      Australians already have between 71 and 43% of the value they create for society stolen from them.
      This surplus value is the profit that get's paid to shareholders as dividends. This stolen
      value is the reason corporate executives can earn more than 30 times as much money,
      (sometimes hundreds of times more money) than the lowest paid workers in a company.
      More than 90% of people would benefit financially from a socialist economic system grounded in the labour theory of value.
      </p>

      <p>
      Paul Cockshott, a scottish Computer Scientist with a BA in Economics and PHD in computer science does a very good job
      of explaining this theory.
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emnYMfjYh1Q"></iframe>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-arn--Gtu-E"></iframe>
      <p>
      Because human labour time is the source of economic value, incomes that do not come from someone's own labour are exploitative.
      That value is not appearing out of nowhere, it is being stolen from someone else. Incomes from rents, dividends, interest and
      royalties are usually forms of exploitation. If we banned individuals or private companies from doing these things, the
      vast majority of the population would be
      substantially better off financially. Sometimes landlords provide some management and maintenance services, but
      the cost of this is usually massively inflated and much higher than it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
      Again, Paul Cockshott does a very nice job of explaining these ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
      In a socialist society there would still be a labour market and therefore people would be paid varying amounts.
      Jobs that are perhaps more difficult or less desireable would be require higher rates of pay to incentivise people
      to do them and less desireable jobs would be paid less. This is similar to a labour market in a capitalist society,
      however, we would eliminate forms of exploitation, passive incomes that do not come from doing any work and incomes
      that are massively inflated because of artificial/manufactured scarcity.
      </p>

      <h1>Manufactured Scarcity</h1>
      <p>
      Our technology has been advanced enough to eliminate poverty within industrialised societies since the late 19th century.
      In 1892 the russian communist Peter Kropotkin estimated that it was only necessary for one man to work 30 hours a week,
      5 hours a day for 6 days a week, in order to meet the needs of a family of 5. Of course, our technology and productive forces
      have improved very dramatically since then and the minimum amount of work time required to meet people's needs should
      have fallen very substantially.

      Today, almost all of our basic needs could be met by robots, the production of almost all the things we need to live
      could be fully automated. For several thousand dollars you can buy a robot that can grow all the fuit and vegetables
      a family will need. https://farmbot.com.au/. A robot can then cook those ingredients into a delicious meal for you.

      laundry, gardening etc https://www.irobot.com.au/. This is easily within the grasp of modern artificial intelligence.

      <p>
      If all this is true, why do we still need to waste years or decades of our lives for rents,  mortgages or food? Why
      do capitalist countries still have huge numbers of homeless people? Why do 5000 children die every day from diseases
      we could easily prevent with vaccines that already exist? Why do hundreds of millions of people still experience famines?

      According to the World Health Organization, 10.4 million children died in 2004 from largely preventable causes like malnutrition and infections.(18) At least two million child deaths a year could be prevented by existing vaccines and most of the rest could be prevented by access to clean
      water, sanitation, and other basic necessities. Nearly 1.3 billion people live in absolute poverty,
      and more than 15 million adults aged 20 to 64 die every year from preventable causes.

      There is a tendency within a capitalist society for the costs of things people need to become massively inflated.
      Capitalists will hoard these goods and services, then extort prices from people that are much larger than necessary.
      The anarchy of the free-market is one of the main problems socialists have resolved with democratic central planning
      of the economy.

      This is essentially why the cost of childcare and housing in Australia have risen so dramatically in recent decades.
      Houses are no more difficult to produce than they used to be, but their price has risen by more than a factor of
      five since the 1980s. These is purely because we need houses, people cannot function in a modern society while living
      on the street. It is also the reason the cost of childcare has tripled in the last three decades. In the USA,
      per capita expenditure on medicine has risen by more than a factor of ten since 1950.

      In the 2016 census, there would roughly 116000 homeless people in Australia and more than a million vacant homes.
      There is by far more than enough homes for everyone and everyone needs a home in order to be a functional member
      of society, but the supply is restricted. People will pay higher rents and mortgages if they are worried about being
      homeless. The land lord tells their tennants to pay them hundreds of dollar every week or tough luck, try sleeping out in
      cold, wind and rain where you are likely to be attacked in the middle of the night at some point or pissed on by drunk
      youths.

      <p>
      The most effective solution to this problem is public monopolies on things people need, or at least overwhelmingly dominant public
      enterprises that provide the things people need. This is why medicine is so vastly cheaper in Australia than the USA,
      we have a strong public healthcare system.
      </p>

    <h1>How does The Democratic Social Network Work?</h1>
    <p>The democratic social network takes what is good about the organization of worker cooperatives and trade unions and
    tries to use the medium of the internet to enhance these strengths. This application is guided by
    the principle that if something is relevant to you and you have the expertise to understand it, you
    should be directly involved in making decisions about it. Democracy is something we should practice
    every day, in all our relationships, not just once every few years. Democracy is compromising,
    consulting, discussing, sharing information, filling in the gaps in each others understanding
    in order to reach much better informed group decisions than any of us could have come to individually.
    Authority should be grounded in wisdom, knowledge and moral integrity instead of coercive, exploitative
    power. People's ability to participate should be independent of how wealthy they are and we should
    make it as easy as possible for people to express their views.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the bottom level of the Democratic Social Network Organization there are small groups of less than 50 people, anyone can create one of
    these. Each of these can elect delegates to higher level groups that represent larger groups of people. These teams can all create and
    enforce rules together with direct democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to promote equality and cooperation between groups there are higher level representative assemblies.
    There are no particular election events, instead you can just vote or withdraw a vote for anyone in your groups at any time.
    These leaders can have their authority taken away whenever the group chooses. This provides a much stronger incentive
    for leaders to consult and discuss with people in order to make choices that most people are happy with and to lead the group in a
    direction that is in the best interests of the group. Higher level representative groups can vote to propose rules and events to
    the lower groups. One of our goals is for people to mostly only be choosing leaders they know personally. This allows us to have
    more confidence in the quality of our leaders' character.
    </p>
    <p>
    Representatives from higher level groups are not allowed to nominate or endorse candidates in lower level groups.
    This helps to ensure a genuinely meritocratic but also democratic organization. There are no election campaigns on this
    web application. However, you can post a resume in your group for other members to look at and evalutate your credentials.
    The choice of leaders or experts should be purely based on their skill, empathy, experience, trustworthyness, wisdom, moral integrity and
    knowledge. Leader selection should have nothing to do with how much money candidates have to spend on a political marketing campaigns
    or how much control they have over the media.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to prevent a situation where people get selected simply because they were first to get any votes, all elected leaders
    must receive at least 75% approval from their group and the most popular members above this threshold can become representatives.
    When you choose who to vote for, try to priortise their actual credentials instead of whether or not you like them personally.
    The democratic social network tries to prevent demagoguery. This is a phenomenon where people gain influence simply with charm
    and charisma, while they may not actual have the competence for leadership. A demagogue is sort of like a sociopath,
    very manipulative and cunning, but the term refers particularly to political leaders. It is nice if leaders are likeable and friendly, but
    this should not be the priority. A real leader tells you what you need to hear, not just what you want to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
    Only two leaders are chosen from each group, however there may be many members who happen to all be
    equally and most popular. For this reason, every three months, two leaders are chosen randomly from this
    group. Ideally, in the long term, we should be aiming for a system where everybody takes a turn as
    a leader. We would randomly choose people to serve a term as a leader, perhaps for three month terms, then
    we cross their name off the list after they have served their term limit. This would mean that
    there could not be anything even sort of like a ruling class or oligarchy and there could not be
    any bias in favour of any particular groups. All groups within society would be proportionately
    represented. African, Asian, European, Indigenous people etc would all have a number of representatives
    that is proportional to the size of their population. We cannot just immediatly do this, leadership
    requires certain qualities. Leaders must be socially conscious, willing to consult, discuss and
    negotiate with their groups in order to find decisions that as many as people as possible are happy
    with. It requires empathy, responsibility, integrity and other characteristics. One of the main goals
    of the Democratic Social Network is to try to encourage these qualities within all users of the
    application and to try to increase the number of people who take their turn as leaders. We really
    believe everyone has the potential to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
    All the groups in this network are relatively small. This is intended to promote deliberative democracy. We want people to be
    making informed choices, have discussions in order to share information, correct each others mistakes and try to arrive
    at decisions that are much better informed than any individual could come up with on their own. It is not enough for people to simply consent
    to a group decision, their should be informed consent. In order to try to prevent the votes of inactive users from distorting the outcome of
    votes on all issues, people's accounts and votes will be deleted if they don't log in three times in one month.
    If this happens, you can still just easily recreate the same account.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this application, all voting is open. You can see exactly who has voted for what, you can even visit higher level representative groups
    in order to observe their discussions. If you are worried about people persecuting you for expressing your thoughts and
    opinions, there are much deeper problems in the group than whether or not voting is secret and anonymous. The real issue is that there
    are imbalances of power that must be fixed. Anonymity mostly makes it easier for people to stab each other in the back and to conceal
    domination or abuse. Secretive voting encourages passive aggressive behaviour. If you are going to vote for something that oppresses, abuses
    or exploits someone else, they should be able to see this and confront you. It is much harder to dehumanize people if you
    must interact with them personally and witness their emotional response to your abuse. Bullies are
    like cockroaches, they hate having light shone onto them. Most bullies are cowards. Groups can enforce
    rules with the Jury tab on each group page. If they vote to create a restriction for a user, the user
    can always see which rules they have supposedly broken, and dispute this if they like. A rule might
    seem like common sense to you, but to someone else with a different background, culture or beliefs,
    it may not. For this reason, all rules are made explicit and can be viewed in the rules tab of the group page.
    For example, in a large Capitalist business, the upper level managers and directors who make most decisions about
    who to hire and fire practically never meet or work directly with the lower level workers and thus they very easily dispose
    of them when their work is no longer profitable to the business.
    In contrast to this, in worker cooperatives, democratic businesses that are owned and run by
    their own workers, people very rarely get fired. The managers and directors are elected by the workers and usually work
    fairly closely with them.

    </p>
    <p>
    There is greater transparency in an open voting system. We encourage users of this application to communicate through other mediums,
    have discussions and talk about why each person voted for the things they voted for. Not only does this help everyone to
    reach better informed choices, it also allows people to scrutineer the web application and ensure there is no voting fraud going on.
    Open voting encourages conversation, if you disagree with people you can try to share information with each
    other in order to reach a mutual understanding. If you don't know who has voted for what, you won't know who you need to
    start the discussion with. If there are any very personal issues that require privacy, we recommend communicating through another medium.
    Of course there are some sensitive issues that call for secrecy, but secret voting certainly should not be the dominant form of
    democratic decision making.
    </p>
    <p>
    Errors are a natural, inevitable and useful
    part of the learning process. A "debate" is an irrational form of discussion that leads to sophistry. Finding the truth is not a
    contest. If we think of our disagreements as a competition, we will try to rationalise our point of view, we will try to
    manipulate or distort the truth in order to fit our perspective. We will selective focus on information that confirms our biases.
    We only think this way because our society is so hierarchical. Powerful people do not need to have valid arguments,
    they can simply impose their views onto others. Often when we disagree with people, we worry that an admission of error will be
    interpretted as an admission of inferiority. However, whether you are right or wrong about any particular question tells us nothing about
    your overall worth as a person. When we mutually arrive at the most accurate answers, everybody wins, regardless of whether
    any individual is correct or incorrect. If I am correct and I fail to persuade you, we both lose. Failure to understand this is the
    root cause of most of the bureaucratic nonesense in our society. Bees can demonstrate the benefits of this sort of thinking.
    When honeybees need to find a new place to build a nest they
    send out hundreds of scouts to search for one. They know exactly what they are all looking for, they need certain height, temperature,
    protection from the weather, access to food etc. The more bees they send out, the greater the chance they will find a better quality
    home. While hundreds of bees investigate, only the best place is chosen and they all unanimously agree to move to this new location
    because it is in everyone's interest to do this.
